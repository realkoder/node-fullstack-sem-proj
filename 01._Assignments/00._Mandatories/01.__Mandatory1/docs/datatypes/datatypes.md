## Types in JavaScript
`JavaScript` is a dynamic language using dynamic valuetypes - values can be assigned and reassigned and a are not directly linked to a specific value type unlike statically typed languages such as `Java`. This means `JavaScript` is a weakly typed language.

#### Types
* String    
* Number
* Bigint
* Boolean
* Undefined
* Null
* Symbol
* Object

### String
In `JavaScript`, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ' ' or double quotes " " or backtic \` \`.
Strings are one of the primitive data types in `JavaScript`, and they represent textual data.
`JavaScript` doesn't support a character datatype so instead characters are treated as strings with the lenght of 1.
Strings in `JavaScript` can be concatenated by the + operator or by template liters / string interpolation with the use of \Â´.
A string is immutable meaning that once it's created it can't change. Instantiated strings can used to create new strings witht the use of string manipulation methods and operations such as `substring(), slice(), replace(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), etc.`.

`(See the code to the right for different string examples)`.

### Number
The number data type represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. If a value can't be converted to a nuber it will return `NaN` (not a number). 
It is used for most numeric computations and operations in JavaScript. Numbers can be written with or without decimals. All numbers in JavaScript, including integers, are represented as floating-point numbers according to the IEEE 754 standard. IEEE 754 standard: `Many hardware floating-point units use the IEEE 754 standard. The standard defines: arithmetic formats: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers), infinities, and special "not a number" values (NaNs)`.

<br>

#### Coercing an argument to a number
`numbers` will be returned as-is. `Undefined` will turn into `nan`. `null` will be 0. `true` will be 1 and `false` 0.
Converting a string by parsing it as if it contains a number literal. Parsing failure results in NaN.

### Bigint
The bigint data type was introduced in `ECMAScript 2020 (ES11)` and allows for the representation of arbitrarily large integers. It is denoted by appending an `n` to the end of an integer literal or by calling the BigInt() constructor function.
It allows developers to represent and work with arbitrarily large integers beyond the safe integer limit imposed by regular JavaScript numbers. Here are some examples of using BigInt in JavaScript.

### Boolean
The `boolean` primitive datatype for `JavaScript` is used to store logical values as either `true` or `false`, they are often
Usecase of boolean values are usually for conditionally operations, including ternary operators `isOdd ? "Number is odd" : "Number is even"`, if...else statements and while loops etc.

<br>

<br>

### Undefined
A variable that has been declared but not been assigned will be of type `undefined`. 
A function will also return `undefined` default if a value is not returned.

<br>

---

<br>

### Null
A variable that has been declared and assigned to `null`.
`null == undefined` will evaluate as true, cause they are loosely equal. `null === undefined` evaluates as false because they are not strictly equal.
Null is used to signify that a variable doesn't have a value or that the variable / object doesn't exist.

<br>

---

<br>

### Symbol
Symbol is a primitive data type introduced in `ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)`.
Instantiating `symbol` quarantees a unique and immutable value that is used as an identifier for object properties. Other primitive data types such as number, string, boolean, null and undefined will be equal to eachother if containing same value such as `true === true` would be true or `1 === 1` would also be true. But having to different constant of the same instantion of Symbol would not be equal.

### Object


```javascript
// DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE EXAMPLE
let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
```

```javascript
// ========================== STRINGS ==========================
// Different ways to instantiate strings in js:
const stringWithDoubleQuote = "One approach ''''''' '''  to defining strings";
const singleQuoteString = 'This is another """"  way  """ of defining a string';
const name = "Brendan Eich";
const backtickString = `And this is another way """" '''' ${name} to define a
multi line string
and also a new line here xD
`;
```

```javascript
// ========================== NUMBER ==========================
let integerNumber = 10; // Integer
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14; // Floating-point number

// Using the scientific (exponent) notation for extra small og large number
let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123

// Coercing numbers
let num = 12; // set num = 12
num = undefined; // set num = NaN
num = null; // set num = 0
num = true; // set num = 1
num = false; // set num = 0
num = "12"; // set num = 12
num = "hello world"; // set num = NaN
```

```javascript
// ========================== BIGINT ==========================
const bigIntNum1 = BigInt(9007199254740991); // Instantiating bigint from number value
const bigIntNum2 = BigInt('123456789012345678901234567890'); // Instantiating bigint from string value

const regularNumber = 12345678901234567890n; // Converting a regular number to BigInt by adding "n" suffix
```

```javascript
// ========================== BOOLEAN ==========================
let isCoding = true;

// Toogle a boolean
isCoding = !isCoding;

// Showcasing logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!)
// These operations evaluate expressions and return boolean values based on the truthiness of the operands.
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // Output: false (AND)
console.log(a || b); // Output: true (OR)
console.log(!a);     // Output: false (NOT)

// Thruthy and falsy values
console.log(Boolean(0));        // Output: false
console.log(Boolean(''));       // Output: false
console.log(Boolean(null));     // Output: false
console.log(Boolean(undefined));// Output: false
console.log(Boolean(NaN));      // Output: false
console.log(Boolean(1));        // Output: true
console.log(Boolean('hello'));  // Output: true

```

```javascript
// ========================== UNDEFINED ==========================
let x;
console.log(x); // outputs undefined

// Undefined return from function
function doSomething() {
    // no return statement
}
console.log(doSomething()); // outputs undefined

// Undefined value for not instantiated key value on object
let drink = {
    name: "Negroni",
    alcPercentage: 24
};

console.log(drink.ingredients); // outputs undefined
```

```javascript
// ========================== NULL ==========================
let x = null; // Instantiating a variable with value of null

// Function returning null
function returnNull() {
    return null;
}
console.log(returnNull()); // Outputs null

// Nullish Coalescing Operator (??):
let x = t ?? "hej";

// Logical OR Operator (||):
let x = t || "hej"; // considers falsy values (0, "", false, NaN, etc.) as falsy, and returns the right-hand operand when encountering any of them.
```

```javascript
// ========================== SYMBOL ==========================
const symbol1 = Symbol('foo');
const symbol2 = Symbol('foo');

console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // Output: false
```


```javascript
// ========================== OBJECT ==========================
