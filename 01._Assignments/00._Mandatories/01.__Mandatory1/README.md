# Mandatory 01

This is my take for mandatory 01 happy reading!

Do the following steps to locally run the project and be able to checkout my webpage.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realkoder/node-fullstack-sem-proj.git
```

```bash
# Place yourself in projects root folder
cd cd node-fullstack-sem-proj/01._Assignments/00._Mandatories/01.__Mandatory1/
```

```bash
# Initializing the project
npm i
```

This will execute the dev script from `package.json` which also runs the ` "build:css": "postcss public/assets/css/tailwind.css -o public/assets/css/styles.css",` so tailwind css gets compiled.
```bash
npm run dev
```
